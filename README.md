**Brief Introduction**:
This project is to extract, explore and analyze the maximum daily energy use, pricing category and weather data. The objective of this project is to develop models which can predict the maximum daily energy use and pricing based on the weather data. Hopefully these models can help energy companies understand plan for future usage, and help businesses plan when to conduct energy-intensive operations.

**Programming Environment**: Python 3.8 and Jupyter Notebook
